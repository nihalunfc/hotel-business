# Project: Utility Optimization for Historic Properties (2026)

This folder contains the technical documentation, data simulations, and predictive models for my internship proposal at **The Brock Hotel / Hilton Properties**.

## 📖 Project Context
Historic hotels in Niagara Falls face unique challenges: high utility costs due to aged infrastructure and extreme seasonal weather. Unlike modern buildings with $100k+ automation systems, this project proposes a **zero-hardware cost** solution through Data Analytics.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
1. **Baseload Identification:** Using Regression Analysis to find the "Waste Floor" (energy used when rooms are vacant).
2. **Predictive Target Setting:** Forecasting daily utility budgets based on check-in schedules and weather forecasts.
3. **Housekeeping Intervention:** Measuring the impact of manual thermal resets (PTAC management) performed by staff.

## 🧮 Theoretical Framework
This project applies rigorous scientific laws to hospitality data:
* **Fourier’s Law of Heat Conduction:** Modeling energy loss through the building envelope.
* **Stochastic Guest Behavior:** Accounting for human variance in water and electricity usage.
* **The Degree-Day Method:** Normalizing energy consumption against Niagara Falls seasonal trends.

## 📂 Contents
* `utility_optimization_story.ipynb`: The full Jupyter Notebook containing equations, Python code, and 10-year data simulations.
* `niagara_hotel_utility_data.csv`: A high-fidelity dataset (2015-2025) simulating real-world hotel metrics.
* `visualizations/`: Graphs comparing Actual vs. Ideal efficiency.

## 📈 Expected ROI
Based on the provided models, the implementation of these data-driven protocols is estimated to save **$2,400+ per month** in "Utility Leakage," providing a 100% return on the internship cost within the first 60 days.
