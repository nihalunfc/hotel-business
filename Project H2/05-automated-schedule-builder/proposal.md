# H2-05: Automated Schedule Builder

**Category:** Workforce operations
**Optimizes:** The weekly staff schedule, so that coverage matches demand, labour rules are met and managers stop building it by hand
**Status:** Proposal

---

## 1. What It Is

A scheduling pipeline that builds next week's schedule automatically for each department, then publishes the same approved schedule to three places at once:

1. **The workforce management system**, through its official API, so that employees who use the app see their shifts as they do today.
2. **An Excel workbook** in the exact layout and colour coding the department already uses, so that managers can review and adjust it in a familiar format.
3. **A printable schedule** for the staff board, so that employees who prefer paper, or who are not comfortable with apps, are not left behind.

Today, many departments still build schedules in large, colour-coded spreadsheets every week. The workforce system is used to display the result, not to optimize it. This pipeline removes the manual building. It keeps every channel people rely on.

## 2. Why It Matters

**Manual scheduling takes managers away from managing.**
- Cornell's hospitality scheduling guide notes that the time a manager spends developing a schedule is time not spent managing employees and serving guests [1].
- In a 2025 survey of over 750 managers, 59% reported spending three or more hours on scheduling tasks, and 39% relied on paper or basic software (vendor survey) [2].

**Optimized schedules perform better than hand-built ones.**
- In a hospital study, a centralized optimization model reduced overtime by about 80%, cut costs by just under 11%, and improved how desirable staff found their schedules by about 34% [3].
- Integer programming has been applied to weekly shift schedules in a hotel department, including rest requirements [4].
- In a retail field experiment, more stable, worker-friendly scheduling raised productivity by 5.1% and sales by 3.3%, while labour cost fell 1.8% [5].

**The rules are complex and checking them by hand is error-prone.** In Ontario, every schedule must respect:
- daily and between-shift rest;
- weekly or biweekly rest periods;
- overtime after 44 hours a week;
- the three-hour rule.

All are set out in the Employment Standards Act guide [6][7]. Collective agreements and seniority rules add further constraints.

**Workforce systems can accept schedules automatically.**
- Leading workforce management platforms, such as Dayforce, offer auto-scheduling and demand-based labour forecasting as product features [8][9].
- Dayforce's API accepts employee schedule data, with an option to validate a schedule without saving it [10].
- Where those modules are not licensed or configured, an external optimizer can still feed the system directly. Nothing needs to be replaced.

**Not everyone works best with an app.**
- Statistics Canada found that adults aged 55 to 65 had the lowest scores across literacy, numeracy and adaptive problem solving [11].
- Internet use among seniors was 82.6% in 2022, compared with 95% for all Canadians aged 15 and over [12].
- In hotels, motor hotels and motels, 12.3% of workers were aged 55 to 64 and 4.5% were 65 to 74 in 2023 [13].
- A printed schedule on the wall is a requirement for inclusion, not an old habit.

## 3. How It Will Be Solved

**Step 1: Demand to hours.**
- Convert the forecast into required hours by department, day and shift: occupancy, arrivals, departures, group functions, restaurant covers and events.
- Use labour standards, for example minutes per checkout room and per stayover room in housekeeping, or front desk agents per 100 arrivals.

**Step 2: Constraints and preferences.** Encode:
- the legal rules [6][7];
- collective agreement and seniority rules;
- employee availability and requests;
- skills and certifications;
- fairness rules such as rotating weekends and spreading less popular shifts.

**Step 3: Optimization.**
- The multi-agent coordination engine treats each employee and each required shift as agents.
- It builds a schedule that covers demand at the lowest cost and overtime, honours preferences where possible, and never breaks a hard rule.
- Every shift carries a reason code, for example "covers forecast 412 departures Saturday".

**Step 4: Manager review.**
- The draft opens in the familiar Excel layout.
- The manager can lock or change any shift. The pipeline re-checks every change against the rules and flags violations immediately.

**Step 5: Publish to all channels.** One approved schedule is:
- pushed to the workforce system through its API, with a validation pass first [10];
- saved as the department's Excel file;
- printed for the staff board.

All three always match because they come from the same source.

**Step 6: Learn.** Actual punches, call-outs and swaps ([H2-01](../01-cross-property-shift-exchange/proposal.md)) feed back into next week's forecast and labour standards.

**Deliverables:**
- A weekly draft schedule per department.
- A rule-check report.
- Synchronized outputs to the workforce system, Excel and print.
- A monthly report on coverage, overtime and schedule stability.

## 4. Data Required

- Employee roster with skills, seniority, availability and contract hours.
- Collective agreement rules.
- Historical schedules and time punches.
- The demand forecast.
- API credentials for the workforce system.
- The current Excel template.

## 5. Risks and Assumptions

- Managers must trust the draft before they stop rebuilding it. The pilot runs one department in parallel with the manual process for several weeks.
- API access must be approved by the system owner. Until then, the Excel and print outputs alone remove most of the manual work.
- Optimization evidence comes from healthcare and retail [3][5]. Hotel-specific gains will be measured in the pilot.
