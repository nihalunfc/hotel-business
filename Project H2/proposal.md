# Project H2: Unified Executive Business Intelligence

### 1. Executive Summary
In large-scale hospitality organizations, data is often fragmented across multiple legacy systems—Property Management Systems (PMS) for rooms, Point of Sale (POS) for Food & Beverage, and separate platforms for Payroll and Finance. This fragmentation results in hundreds of hours lost each month manually compiling billing, invoicing, and month-end executive packs.

**Project H2** proposes an end-to-end, automated Business Intelligence solution. Instead of relying exclusively on heavy, expensive third-party BI software, Project H2 utilizes a lightweight, highly efficient stack: **Self-contained HTML pages backed by robust SQL stored procedures and Python automation.**

This architecture is designed to eliminate manual data entry, ensure numbers strictly tie back to their source, and deliver actionable insights to the executive floor in real-time.

### 2. The Technical Architecture

#### Pillar 1: Advanced SQL Data Unification (The Engine)
The foundation of Project H2 is built on writing clean, highly optimized SQL.
*   **The Concept:** Rather than exporting multiple CSVs from different systems and combining them in Excel, the data is unified at the database level.
*   **The Execution:** Complex SQL Stored Procedures utilize advanced joins, grouping, and window functions to seamlessly merge `fact_daily_revenue`, `fact_pos_transactions`, and `fact_payroll`. This allows the system to instantly calculate critical metrics, such as Labor Cost Percentage against Total Daily Revenue across multiple properties.

#### Pillar 2: Python Automation Jobs (The Worker)
Manual billing, invoicing, and generating month-end packs are highly susceptible to human error and consume valuable analyst time.
*   **The Concept:** Rebuilding manual processes as automated jobs that run themselves.
*   **The Execution:** Scheduled Python scripts query the SQL database at the end of each month. The scripts autonomously generate, format, and distribute month-end reconciliation packs and vendor invoices, reducing a 3-day manual process to a 3-minute automated job.

#### Pillar 3: Self-Contained HTML Dashboards (The UI)
Executives and General Managers need fast, secure, and intuitive access to their numbers without navigating complex BI software permissions.
*   **The Concept:** Delivering data through lightweight, self-contained HTML pages.
*   **The Execution:** Utilizing vanilla JavaScript and data visualization libraries (like Chart.js), the front-end dashboard reads the outputs of the SQL stored procedures. The result is a clean, browser-based "Flash Report" that executives can open instantly on any device to monitor real-time RevPAR, F&B covers, and labor variances.

### 3. Business Impact and Practical Application
Project H2 is designed to immediately impact the bottom line by focusing on operational efficiency:
*   **Hours Removed:** Automating month-end packs and billing saves significant labor hours, freeing analysts to focus on forward-looking strategy rather than backward-looking data entry.
*   **Data Integrity:** By utilizing strict SQL stored procedures, the numbers displayed on the HTML dashboards always tie directly back to the unmanipulated source data.
*   **Agile Development:** Utilizing AI-assisted development protocols allows these bespoke reporting tools to be built, tested, and deployed to the executive floor in days, not quarters.
